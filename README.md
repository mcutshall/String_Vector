# String_Vector
This program creates a string vector and populates it with text from a .txt file of 
pcc campus information. The program then capitalizes the first letter of each word, and both letters
of any state abbreviation, such as AZ. The split and capitalized information stored in the vector
is then written to a .txt file called "pcc_campuses_revised", which is stored in the project folder, along
with the original "pcc_campuses.txt" file.
